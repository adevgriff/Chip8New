# Chip8New

Chip 8 Project to compare to my original to see how I have managed to grow as a programmer
also being shown at schools open house and living on my portfolio.

Some instructions are not working correctly but have not been found yet but passes all tests in the test file I have access to right now.

currently runs pong and tic tac toe correctly.

controls fully implemented but not sound yet.

Also at the moment needs to be recompiled to run the next program will fix this soon.
